# PORTFOLIO-WEBSITE
Created a personal online resume website using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. Structured the website into multiple sections: Home, About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact Me for clear and user-friendly navigation. Integrated features to showcase certificates, resume, projects and my gate scorecard allowing visitors to view or download professional documents. Applied responsive design techniques using CSS media queries to ensure optimal display across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
